    <p>Steve Bockman is an independent software developer who began his career in
1977 in a utility position, installing software packages for a manufacturer
of business computers. Since then he has worked in the fields of speech
recognition, terrain analysis, computer graphics, desktop publishing,
industrial automation and web applications.<br/></p>


	<p>Steve&#8217;s first exposure to anything Agile occurred around 2000, when a
co-worker suggested that they try pair programming. He liked what he saw,
but didn&#8217;t get involved again until 2005, while participating in a
development effort in which changing requirements were part of the ground
rules. He has been happily exploring Agile techniques ever since.</p>
