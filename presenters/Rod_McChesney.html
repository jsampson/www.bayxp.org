    <p>Rod McChesney has been developing software professionally since
1982. He&#8217;s worked in a variety of areas for companies including Tibco,
Sun Microsystems (including SunSoft and JavaSoft), NOCPulse, and
Openwave.  He&#8217;s currently at at Postini (soon to be a Google
subsidiary) working as the technical lead for the web applications
group.</p>


	<p>At NOCpulse he worked on a SaaS system monitoring product that was
developed with a home-rolled agile approach, delivering updates every
three to four weeks. Having seen how well this can work in practice,
he&#8217;s tried to bring the ideas to teams at other companies, with
varying success. The Postini web applications team has been using its
own agile approach for about a year, and using XPlanner for about the
last six months.</p>
