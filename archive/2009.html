	<h3>The Value of Refactoring on an Agile Team</h3>


	<p><a href='http://www.meetup.com/silicon-valley-agile/calendar/10743720/'>Tuesday, July 14th, 2009</a></p>


	<p>Refactoring is often viewed as a technique to clean up existing messy code. If that were always true, then Agile projects would require up-front design, because teams rarely get around to those &#8220;big refactorings,&#8221; and rarely will a Scrum PO or XP Customer buy (prioritize) a &#8220;refactoring story.&#8221; In truth, Agile processes require design to emerge. Rob will describe what it means to refactor clean, well-tested code. He will also demonstrate the actual business value of refactoring, and suggest ways to make sure refactoring and Emergent Design are given the necessary time to flourish.</p>


	<h3>BayXP/SV Agile event planning</h3>


	<p><a href='http://www.meetup.com/silicon-valley-agile/calendar/9960809/'>Wednesday, March 25th, 2009</a></p>


	<p>We&#8217;ve been enjoying these monthly discussions so much we thought it would be worth trying something a little larger in scale. This meeting will be to start the planning a larger event so please attend if you&#8217;re interested in helping to organize the event. Some of the decisions to be made:</p>


	<ul>
	<li>Agenda: What do we want to talk about? Fix a theme or pot-luck?</li>
		<li>Audience: open to public? invite only? require people to apply to attend?</li>
		<li>Format: lectures? workshops? open space?</li>
		<li>Duration/timing: 1 day? 2-day? Mid-week vs weekend?</li>
		<li>Cost: charge admission? get sponsorship?</li>
	</ul>


	<p>Be the change you want to see in the world&#8230; starting with the event you&#8217;d like to attend.</p>


	<h3>What is the Agile Core? Practices and/or Values</h3>


	<p><a href='http://www.meetup.com/silicon-valley-agile/calendar/9678329/'>Wednesday, February 25th, 2009</a></p>


	<h4>Discussion topic:</h4>


	<p>At the last meeting there was a questions: why is waterfall so easy to describe, but it is so hard to describe Agile?</p>


	<p>This is a problem because things that are easy to describe spread faster and broader than things that are hard to describe.</p>


	<p>So is there a core to Agile that is easy to describe?</p>


	<p>Are there some practices that are simply non-negotiable?</p>


	<p>How would you describe Agile to someone who had never heard of it? How would you describe it to a skeptic?</p>


	<p>If talking through these questions around the table sounds like fun, come on down and join us.</p>


	<h4>Aha Moments:</h4>


	<ul>
	<li>I might have to change my organization</li>
		<li>It&#8217;s not a unified answer (like an elephant)</li>
		<li>Hmm&#8230; I had four principles but turned out that I couldn&#8217;t remember the one about value</li>
		<li>There is no core of agile that is easy to describe</li>
		<li>All the answers are right but all different.  So maybe there is something fundamental that it is not possible to describe. </li>
		<li>Trust keeps coming up.  I think I need to do a lot of deep thinking about how to gain trust</li>
		<li>Both core and non-negotiable are highly contextual and depends on what you don&#8217;t have</li>
		<li>You can&#8217;t go very fast unless you are disciplined.</li>
	</ul>


	<h3>Theme Discussion: There&#8217;s An Idea I&#8217;d Like to Try (SV Agile + BayXP)</h3>


	<p><a href='http://www.meetup.com/silicon-valley-agile/calendar/9468994/'>Wednesday, January 21st, 2009</a></p>


	<h4>Discussion topics:</h4>


	<ul>
	<li>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to try having the team work on just one feature at a time. No iterations, just a single feature from start to finish, rinse &#38; repeat.&#8221; </li>
		<li>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to try having &#8216;automated monkey testing&#8217;, a tool that would explore the application with random input to find problems.&#8221; </li>
		<li>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to try having personas (from Goal Oriented Design) that could plug into automated acceptance test, so you could test different paths to the same behavior.&#8221; </li>
		<li>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to try starting from a photoshop mockup and then code through the application reaching the data layer last. This is backwards from my usual approach.&#8221;</li>
	</ul>


	<h4>Aha Moments:</h4>


	<ul>
	<li>Corey: We&#8217;re not doing enough user persona modeling.</li>
		<li>Doug: I had never considered persona based testing before.</li>
		<li>Tye: It was new to think of a hierarchy of importance that goes Interaction &gt; Domain &gt; Data Layer.</li>
		<li>Kevin: It is shocking how often we think of the role of QA as being destructive. (About breaking things rather than confirming that behavior works.)</li>
		<li>Mark: Get one thing done before moving on. (But why is it that some of us want it? It feels like nobody else does&#8230;)</li>
		<li>Dave: I need exercises for working outside my comfort zone, for removing scar tissue. Without that I&#8217;m missing opportunities to improve.</li>
		<li>Mark: Why is waterfall so easy to describe while describing agile so hard? (This will be the theme for next month&#8217;s meetup!)</li>
		<li>Jeff: People don&#8217;t like to do what they&#8217;re bad at, they avoid it. They&#8217;d rather do what they&#8217;re good at. (A duh and aha at the same time.)</li>
		<li>Kevin: Don&#8217;t make me do stuff I&#8217;m not good at it.</li>
		<li>Phillippe: Automated monkey testing after a good quick smoke test could be useful.</li>
		<li>Phillippe: Need focus in an iteration rather than a random collection of stories.</li>
	</ul>
